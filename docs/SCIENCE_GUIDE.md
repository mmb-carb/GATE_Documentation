# The Basic Science in GATE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION


## Photochemic Modeling on a 3D Grid

> Coming Soon: Describe what we want that for airplanes. Show current 3D plots.


## Flight Paths in 3D

> Coming Soon: Describe what we know about runways and flight paths. Show a 3D line plot.


## Flight Paths on the 3D Grid

> Coming Soon: Intersect the above, for each runway, with the 3D grid. Show 3D box plot.


## Applying this to Emissions Inventories

> Coming Soon: Emissions up to the ABL and Flight stage fractions


## Temporal Profiles

> Coming Soon: The BTS has a lot of data.
