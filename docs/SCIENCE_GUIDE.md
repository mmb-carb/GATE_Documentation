# The Basic Science in GATE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION


## Photochemic Modeling on a 3D Grid

> Coming Soon

1. Describe photochemical modeling and emissions inventories
2. Describe aircraft inventories (up to X feet / ABL) and show typical aircraft 3D gridding
3. The goal of GATE is to improve upon the above plot


## 3D Flight Paths

> Coming Soon

1. Describe runway information gathering (AirportIQ ref). Show LAX plot and discuss taxiing emissions.
2. Discuss take-off and landing angles / flight paths.  (refs)
3. Discuss wireframe model of a runway / airport. Show plot.


## Intersecting Flight Paths with a 3D Grid

> Coming Soon

1. Discuss intersecting above wireframe with grid.  Discuss problem complexity.
2. Give mathematical approach to solution (ref).
3. Show LAX spatial surrogates (3 x stage), for one runway. Discuss.


## Applying this to Emissions Inventories

> Coming Soon

1. Discuss splitting aircraft emissions by flight stage. (refs)
2. Show final LAX plot (all runways and stages) and discuss.
3. Discuss improvements?  (grid intersect and EDMS for stage)


## Temporal Profiles

> Coming Soon

1. Show temporal analysis from BTS (ref) commercial flight data.
2. Show example temporal profiles
